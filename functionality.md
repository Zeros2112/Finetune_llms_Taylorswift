# Taylor Swift Language Model - Project Functionality

This document provides an overview of what the Taylor Swift Language Model project can do based on the code provided.

## 1. Fine-Tuning Process

### `finetuning_notebook.ipynb`

The Jupyter notebook `finetuning_notebook.ipynb` is responsible for the fine-tuning process of a language model on the Taylor Swift dataset. Key steps include:

- **Dataset Loading:** Loading the Taylor Swift dataset for fine-tuning.
- **Tokenization:** Tokenizing and splitting the dataset for training and testing.
- **Model Configuration:** Configuring the language model, tokenizer, and other training parameters.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning the language model on the Taylor Swift dataset.
- **Saving the Model:** Saving the final fine-tuned model for deployment.

## 2. Web Application Deployment

### `app.py`

The `app.py` file contains the Flask web application responsible for deploying the fine-tuned language model. It includes:

- **Web Interface:** A user-friendly web interface for users to input questions about Taylor Swift.
- **Model Inference:** The ability to perform real-time model inference to generate responses based on user queries.
- **Model Loading:** Loading the pre-trained language model onto the appropriate device (GPU/CPU) for inference.
- **Interactive Experience:** Providing an interactive experience for users to obtain context-aware answers related to Taylor Swift.

## 3. Model Inference

### `inference` Function

The `inference` function within `app.py` is responsible for:

- **Tokenization:** Tokenizing user-input questions.
- **Model Generation:** Generating model responses based on the tokenized input.
- **Prompt Stripping:** Stripping the generated response of any initial prompt provided in the input.

## 4. Logging and Configuration

### `utilities.py`

The `utilities.py` module includes functions for:

- **Logging:** Setting up logging configurations to record important events and messages during the fine-tuning and deployment processes.
- **Configuration Management:** Initializing and managing configuration settings, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.

## 5. Web Application Interface

### `templates/index.html`

The `index.html` file in the `templates` directory defines the HTML template for the web application interface. It includes:

- **Input Form:** A form for users to input questions.
- **Prediction Display:** Displaying the generated answer based on the user's input.
- **Styling:** CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the web page.

## 6. Additional Components

- **`static/` Directory:** Contains static assets (CSS, JS, etc.) for styling and interactive features of the web application.
- **`requirements.txt`:** Lists dependencies that need to be installed for the project.

This documentation provides an overview of the capabilities of the Taylor Swift Language Model project. Users can interact with the model through the web interface to obtain context-aware answers to questions about Taylor Swift.
